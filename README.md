### When can this Application be very useful ?

Apart from the minimal setup the export.json file has a lot of advanced properties that can be leveraged in creating and running complex migration jobs.

Therefore in some cases the json file may become very long and hard to edit it manually using the standard Notepad. 

Now with this Desktop Application you don't have to work with the Notepad and the Console, because all actions are performed in a visual mode. Now it's very simple to manage the migration jobs. You can add and remove org connections, set up SObjects and fields, then run the Plugin from the application itself.

## Notes

* This Application must have the [SFDMU Plugin](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility) to be installed in your system previously.
* The Application puts user's data files into the standard **Documents** folder inside dedicated sub-folder named **/SFDMU_APP**.  
  You can change the default path in the application's ***App Settings*** page. 
* The Application also creates a file **user.json** in the application installation directory. This file is being used to store the application settings.
  Make sure you are **NOT DELETING** this file during upgrade the Application from the git repository, otherwise the settings will be lost.
* The Application supports multiple local users. 
  Each user has his own local profile contains all his data, that is encrypted by the encryption key which is the password that is used to login into the application. 
  So user's data never directly exposed to others. But after the creating of your local user's profile, you need to well remember your password because there is no password recovery option.



## Supported OS

Normally all major OS (Win, MACOS, Linux) should be supported.  It was successfully tested on Windows and MACOS machines.

Sometimes MAC users may have problems installing and launching the Application, because the Electron platform fails to install and run correctly on these local systems. For the current moment we can't provide a reliable solution for this issue. 

According to the live experience the Application is always working fine in Windows-based systems.
